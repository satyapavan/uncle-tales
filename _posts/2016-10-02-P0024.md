Dear Friends,  <br>
   <br>
 The white house ( USA) has started a online petition to declare Pakistan a terrorist state. You can participate in this and sign the petition. Based on the number of people participating and voting the white house will decide whether to forward the same and declare Pakistan a terrorist state. I give below steps to do the same. I have already participated and urge you to do the same.  <br>
   <br>
 Step 1. Log on to www.whitehouse.gov  <br>
   <br>
 Step 2. On the main page go to the bottom screen and press Participate.  <br>
   <br>
 Step 3. On this page you will find a header called " we the people" petitions. Click on that.  <br>
   <br>
 Step 4. Go to the petition which is shown as petition to declare pakistan a terrorist state. Click on that  <br>
   <br>
 Step5. Click on sign up and you will have to mention you name and email id.  <br>
   <br>
 Step 6. You will get a confirmation email with a link to confirm your petition. Click on the same and your application will be counted.  <br>
   <br>
 Do it in large numbers and forward this to your family and friends. We need to act this time and make sure we force America to declare Pakistan a terrorist state  <br>
   <br>
