Awesomee ......A story in one of the schools in Chennai where admission is considered impossible!!!  <br>
   <br>
 To get UKG admission  <br>
   <br>
 The child could not understand why they brought her there..  <br>
   <br>
 When we all were standing, the school principal started to converse with the child....yes...in English only! This is one of the most memorable interview I have ever witnessed in my life..  <br>
 Here goes..  <br>
   <br>
 "What's your name?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Sarithra"  <br>
   <br>
 "Good. Tell me something you know"  <br>
   <br>
 "I know many things. Tell me what you want...!"  <br>
   <br>
 Alas, there is no better point for not getting the admission!  <br>
   <br>
 Sarithra's mother was trying to make up the situation but the principal stopped her..  <br>
   <br>
 Turning to child, she said.. "Tell any rhyme or story which you know.."  <br>
   <br>
 Again,"Which one you want.. Rhyme or Story!?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Ok. Plz tell me a story.."  <br>
   <br>
 "Do uou want to hear what I studied or what I wrote..!?"  <br>
   <br>
 Taken to surprise, she asked "Oh! you write stories...???"  <br>
   <br>
 "Why should I not write..?"  <br>
   <br>
 Now even I was taken aback But she was impressed with the answer. She ( including us) would have not heard such a story in our life...  <br>
   <br>
 Ok, tell me story which you have written-?  <br>
   <br>
 Sarithra said "Ravanan kidnapped Sita & took her to Srilanka"  <br>
   <br>
 The opening scene failed to impress but still she encouraged the child to continue..  <br>
   <br>
 "Rama asked Hanumans help to rescue Sita. Hanuman too agreed to help Rama ..."  <br>
   <br>
 "Then?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Now, Hanuman called his friend Spider man." No one expected this twist in the story!!  <br>
   <br>
 "Why?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Because there are lot of mountains between India and Srilanka.. but if we have Spiderman we can go easily with his rope..."  <br>
   <br>
 "But Hanuman can fly isn't it.. ?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Yes. But he is having Sanjeevi Mountain on one hand so he cannot fly very fast.!"  <br>
   <br>
 All is quiet, after a while Sarithra asked "Should I continue or not?.".  <br>
   <br>
 "Ok plz continue!"  <br>
   <br>
 "Hanuman and Spiderman flew to Srilanka and rescued Sita. Sita said Thanks to both!"  <br>
   <br>
 "Why"  <br>
   <br>
 "When you are helped you should say Thanks!"  <br>
   <br>
 So Sita requested Hanuman to call Hulk..."  <br>
   <br>
 All were surprised.She realized our curiosity and said " Now Sita is there, so to take her safely back to Rama she called Hulk"  <br>
   <br>
 "What??? "Hanuman can carry Sita right?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Yes. But he has Sanjeevi Mountain in one hand and has to hold spider man on the other"  <br>
   <br>
 No one could control thier smiles. " So when they all started to India they met my friend Akshay! "  <br>
   <br>
 "How come Akshay there now?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Because its my story and I can bring any one there!"  <br>
   <br>
 The principal didn't get angry but waited for the next twist  <br>
   <br>
 Then all started to India and landed at Chennai Velechery bus stop!  <br>
   <br>
 Now I asked,"Why they have landed In Velechery bus stop?  <br>
   <br>
 "Because they forgot the way..& Hulk got an idea and called Dora!"  <br>
   <br>
 I came to know about Dora only there...!  <br>
   <br>
 "Dora came and she took Sita to Velechery Venus Colony...that's all!"  <br>
   <br>
 She finished the story with a smile.. 😀  <br>
   <br>
 The principal asks "Why venus Colony...?"  <br>
   <br>
 "Because sita lives there & i am Sita!!!"  <br>
   <br>
 The principal was impressed and embraced the child. She has been admitted in UKG & was gifted with a Dora doll...  <br>
 😊☺👍👍👏👏☺😊  <br>
   <br>
 Kids can really amaze... but we clip their wings (creativity) expecting them to do things as we see it right & not from their viewpoint.  <br>
   <br>
 Let's give every child freedom to do their own thing & watch their dreams come true...  <br>
   <br>
 👆 it is One of the good posts I've seen
