Once a Mother beats up her son and when son starts crying, Mother says sorry.  <br>
   <br>
 Smart Son says : Take a piece of paper. Crumble it. Fold it. Now open it. Say "sorry" to it. Are the scars on the paper gone? Nahi na.. Relationships are like this .  <br>
   <br>
 Smarter Mom says : Take my scooty and try to start. does it start ? Nahin naa... Now give it 3-4 kicks. Now does it start ? Hua na... Nalayak...Tu wahi scooter hai, koi paper - waper nahi. Aage se ye Facebook/WhatsApp wale gyaan apne Maa ko mat dena.  <br>
