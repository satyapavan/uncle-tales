Teacher asked student:  <br>
 "Why do you think Parvathi chose shiva as her husband?"  <br>
   <br>
 So student gave 5 points:  <br>
 1. Shiva does not wear clothes since he is a digambara. So no issue of washing clothes.  <br>
 2. He has the ðŸŒ™ on his head so no problem of load shedding and no issues of bill payments.  <br>
 3. he has Ganga flowing so no shortage of water.  <br>
 4. Shiva eats only raw veggies so no issues of cooking.  <br>
 5. Since he does not have parents no in-laws problems.  <br>
   <br>
 So immediately the teacher fell at the students feet and requested him to take him as his student! :D :D :D
