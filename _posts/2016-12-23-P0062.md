THE MENU AT A DAHI CHOLEY CHAAT SHOP ---VERY FUNNY READ TILL END. .  <br>
   <br>
 1) Chaat-- Rs.10  <br>
 2) Special chaat - Rs.12  <br>
 3) Very Special chaat - Rs. 15.  <br>
 4) Extra Special chaat- Rs. 18.  <br>
 5) Double Extra Special chaat- Rs. 20.  <br>
 6) Sunday Special chaat - Rs. 25 (Sunday only).  <br>
   <br>
 To check each and every chaat for its different taste, I started eating everyday a different one. . . . .  <br>
   <br>
 But soon I discovered that each and every one had the same taste of Chaat.  <br>
   <br>
 Finally one day I asked him the reason for the same taste?  <br>
 💷 💵 💴  <br>
