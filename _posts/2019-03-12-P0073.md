Difficult to believe! So many skeletons tumbling out of the closet after so many years of sweeping under the carpet!  <br>

 The Sultan of Oman offered the port of Gwadar to India in 1958 for ONLY $1 million. Nehru rejected the offer.  <br>
   <br>
 Pakistan subsequently bought Gwadar. Today, it is a major strategically located port. China is investing billions.  <br>
   <br>
 The US offered PM Nehru a Permanent seat for India at the UN Security Council in 1950. Nehru rejected the offer.  <br>
   <br>
 Rejecting the offer for a Permanent seat at the UN Security Council, Nehru said: "Not at the cost of China".  <br>
   <br>
 The US & USSR again offered PM Nehru a Permanent seat for India at the UN Security Council in 1955. Nehru AGAIN rejected the offer. He INSISTED that priority be given to China instead of India. Nehru ensured that China got a Permanent seat at the UN Security Council AT THE EXPENSE OF India.  <br>
   <br>
 Today, because of Nehru, China has the opportunity to repeatedly harm India's interests at the UN.  <br>

 Gandhi, Nehru, the Congress, & Leftists suppressed the truth about 1000 years of muslim atrocities in India. - https://t.co/oHYcoyWODx  <br>

 PM Nehru GIFTED the Kabo Valley (Manipur, 11,000+ sq. km.) to Burma. Was it his ancestral property, to gift?  <br>
 https://t.co/nEieggsUhA  <br>
   <br>
 Burma paid a monthly lease for the Kabo valley until 1949. After that, with Nehru's consent, it stopped paying & annexed the valley. Nehru did not take Parliament's consent for this act. Congress-dominated Parliament did not intervene, nor did later governments.  <br>
   <br>
 PM Nehru GIFTED the Coco Islands (Andamans) to Burma. The Burmese gave them to CHINA to spy on India.  <br>

 PM Nehru & sister Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit marketing snake-charmer image of India to US First Lady Jackie Kennedy. https://twitter.com/IndianInterest/status/721183731118047232  <br>

 Secular #Nehru tried to prevent Sardar Patel from liberating Hyderabad from murderous Nizam. Called him a "complete communalist".  <br>
   <br>
 In the early 1950s, Nepal's King Tribhuvan offered to merge with India. Nehru rejected it. - https://t.co/2SVbksLI7W  <br>
   <br>
 Nepal had offered to merge with India after independence. PM Jawaharlal Nehru refused. https://t.co/JnlkfCJuTu  <br>
   <br>
 Nehru lied to Parliament on September 28, 1955. Said there had been no offer for a seat for India in the UNSC. https://t.co/l3xeLlcocd  <br>
   <br>
 US president Kennedy offered to help India detonate a nuclear device BEFORE the 1962 China war. Nehru refused. - https://t.co/LPgR66C2A9  <br>
   <br>
 Had Nehru accepted Kennedy's offer of assistance, India would have been the first Asian nuclear power, AHEAD of China.  <br>
 Had Nehru accepted Kennedy's offer of assistance, China would not have dared invade India in 1962. Nor Pakistan in 1965.  <br>
 Had Nehru accepted Kennedy's offer of assistance, India would have been a FOUNDING MEMBER of the Nuclear Suppliers Group.  <br>
   <br>
 Everyone should read "Nehru's 97 Major Blunders" a superb, eye-opening book by @Rajnikant_rkp. Highly recommended. https://t.co/rH8ZjS4O4p
