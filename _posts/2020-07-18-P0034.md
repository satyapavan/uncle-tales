   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Let's find out just how clever you really are .  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Ready?  <br>
   <br>
 GO!!! (Scroll down)  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Question 1 :  <br>
   <br>
 You are participating in a race. You overtake the second person. What position are you in?  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>

   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 -Answer: If you answered that you are first, then you are absolutely wrong! If you overtake the second person and you take his place, you are second!  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Try not to mess up in the next question.  <br>
   <br>
 To answer the second question, don't take as much time as you took for the first question.  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Question 2 :  <br>
   <br>
 If you overtake the last person, then you are...?  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Answer: If you answered that you are second to last, then you are wrong again. Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST person?!  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 You're not very good at this! Are you?  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Question 3 :  <br>
   <br>
 Very tricky math! Note: This must be done in your head only. Do NOT use paper and pencil or a calculator. Try it.  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Take 1000 and add 40 to it. Now add another 1000. Now add 30. Add another 1000. Now add 20. Now add another 1000. Now add 10. What is the total?  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Did you get 5000? The correct answer is actually 4100.  <br>
 Don't believe it? Check with your calculator! Today is definitely not your day. Maybe you will get the last question right?  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Question 4 :  <br>
   <br>
 Mary's father has five daughters: 1. Tana, 2. Tene, 3. Tini, 4. Tono. What is the name of the fifth daughter?  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>

   <br>

   <br>

   <br>

 Question 5 :  <br>
   <br>
 There is a mute person who wants to buy a toothbrush. By imitating the action of brushing one's teeth he successfully expresses himself to the shopkeeper and the purchase is done.  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Now if there is a blind man who wishes to buy a pair of sunglasses, how should he express himself?  <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>
 ......  <br>
   <br>

   <br>
