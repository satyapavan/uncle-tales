Ph no 8051440207  <br>
 Got a call from a person telling ..... i m from RBI we r doing the ATM verification process for all the banks. Please share all the ATM details u r carrying against ur Name.We r not asking for Pin but only the card no.  <br>
 On Denying, he shared my correct name (may b from true caller) n told its a government verification process n i m not cooperating this. He started threatening me that they ve all my details n ll block all my ATM and now my account balance ll be zero n all money ll be credited to government account until i complete the verification process.  <br>
   <br>
 If u disconnect the call he calls u back to threaten.  <br>

 üôè please educate ur house helps, elderly ppl or kids at home to never ever share any details. It's really a useful, purposeful,  good news to share. Will share to all please...
