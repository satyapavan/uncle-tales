*JUST FOR LAUGHS*  <br>
   <br>
 Narendra Modi walked into a bar and sat down next to Rahul Gandhi and they started watching the TV...  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 The 10 pm news was coming on. The news crew was covering the story of a man on the ledge of a large building preparing to jump.  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Rahul looked at Modi and said, "Do you think he will jump?"  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Modi said, "You know, I bet he will jump."  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Rahul replied, "Well, I bet he won't."  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Modi placed Rs. 1000 bill on the bar and said, "You're on!"  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Rahul too placed his money on the bar, the guy on the ledge jumped off the building, falling to his death.  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Rahul was very upset, but willingly handed his Rs.1000 to Modi, saying, "Fair is fair. Here's your money."  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Modi replied, "I can't take your money. I saw this earlier at the 5 pm news, and so I knew he would jump."  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Rahul replied, "I too watched, but didn't think he would do it again.  <br>
   <br>
   <br>
 Modi took the money.
