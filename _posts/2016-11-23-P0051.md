Everyone is facing difficulties due to demonetisation, but everyone is still happy, because:  <br>
   <br>
 Poor man thinks the rich are finished  <br>
   <br>
 Servant thinks maalik is finished  <br>
   <br>
 Worker thinks boss is finished  <br>
   <br>
 Patient thinks Doc is finished  <br>
   <br>
 Clerk thinks Bureaucrat is finished  <br>
   <br>
 Bureaucrat thinks politicians are finished  <br>
   <br>
 Ruling party thinks opposition is finished  <br>
   <br>
 And opposition thinks Modi is finished!  <br>
   <br>
 Life is beautiful, because of the human trait - Misery loves company! ðŸ˜€
