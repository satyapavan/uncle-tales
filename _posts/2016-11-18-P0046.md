Dear friends,  <br>
 There is a message floating around saying that you can go to a website called _cashornocash com_ to know which ATMs have money and which do not.  <br>
 Pl do NOT click on the link..it is a fake phishing site to insert malware into your phone [clicking on it will take you to a non-decrepit site with malware to automatically _silently_ download on your phone in the background]  <br>
 Hackers are busy using the current situation to steal your data and identity. Stay alert!  <br>
 Pl forward to friends and family and loved ones for their safety too.
