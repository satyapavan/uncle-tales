 Nos of days of six yr is 2200 days  <br>
   <br>
 So Rs. 5,00,000/2200        = Rs.   230 /day  <br>
 Yearly insu Rs 15000        = Rs       41/day  <br>
 Daily petrol      minimum   = Rs    100/Day  <br>
 After every 3 yr tyre &  <br>

 Plus interest loss on  <br>
 Car buying amount  <br>
 @8% on Rs 6,00,000           = Rs 131/day  <br>
