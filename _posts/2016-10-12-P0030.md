IMPORTANT & URGENT  <br>
 As per media reports: Pakistan cannot fight with India directly, so taking help of China to take revenge on India. China is filling crackers with special kind of chemicals which on burning release gasses more poisonous than Carbonmonoxide. This is to cause serious breathing problems leading to asthma to us Indians. In addition China is making special decorative lamps which cause serious eye problems. This way Pakistan in league with China is planning for a biological war against India. This will have a disastrous effect on our future generations also.  <br>
 So we should be more cautious in our coming Diwali celebrations and avoid using Chinese crackers.  <br>
 Please spread this message to as many our countrymen as possible at the earliest.  <br>
