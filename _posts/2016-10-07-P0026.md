A Pakistani boy took admission in an American school ...  <br>
 Teacher : Whats your name ?  <br>
 Boy : Nadir  <br>
 Teacher : No, now you are in America, your name is Johnny from today.  <br>
 Boy went home and his mother asked: How was the day Nadir?  <br>
 Boy : I am an American now, so call me Johnny.  <br>
 Mom and Dad both got offended and beat him up.  <br>
 Next day he was back to school all bruised ...  <br>
 Teacher : What happened Johnny ?  <br>
 Boy: Ma'm, just 6 hours after I became American, I was attacked by two Pakistani terrorists.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜œ
