 🔥A woman's experience with burns ...🔥  <br>
   <br>
 Some time ago I was cooking some corn and stuck my fork in the boiling water to see if the corn was ready. I missed and my hand went into the boiling water....!!  <br>
   <br>
 A friend of mine, who was a Vietnam vet, came into the house, as I was screaming, & asked me if I had some plain old wheat flour...  <br>
   <br>
 I pulled out a bag and he stuck my hand in it. He told me to keep my hand in the flour for 10 minutes.  <br>
   <br>
 He said, In Vietnam , there was a guy on fire and in their panic, they threw a bag of flour all over him to put the fire out...Well, it not only put the fire out, but he never even had a blister!!!!  <br>
   <br>
 ... Long story short, I put my hand in the bag of flour for 10 mins, pulled it out and did not even have a red mark or a blister & absolutely NO PAIN.  <br>
   <br>
 Now, I keep a bag of flour in the fridge and every time I burn myself. *Cold flour feels even better than room temperature flour.  <br>
   <br>
 I use the wheat flour and have never ever had even a red spot/burn mark, or a blister!  <br>
   <br>
 I even burnt my tongue once, put the flour on it for about 10 minutes .... the pain was gone and no burn.  <br>
   <br>
 Try it . . . Experience a miracle!  <br>
   <br>
 Keep a bag of flour in your fridge and you will be happy you did!  <br>
