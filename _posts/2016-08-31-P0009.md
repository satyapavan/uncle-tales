 Waiter - Idly , vada, uppma, pongal, dosa , poori, parotta, naan, oothappam, idiyappam..  <br>
   <br>
 Banker - OK ok..bring idly, vada, and dosa. And 2 oothappam for parcel..  <br>
   <br>
 Waiter - Sorry sir...all sold out. Nothing is left.  <br>
   <br>
 Banker - Why then the hell you recited such a big menu ?  <br>
   <br>
 Waiter - Sir ,  I go  to your ATM daily. After asking for  PIN , Account details, Amount required , whether printed receipt required  etc.,  <br>
 It finally says ' 'No Cash'.....  <br>
