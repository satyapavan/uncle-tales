🍁Happy daughter's week.  <br>
 🙍👭🙍👭🙍👭  <br>
   <br>
 Daughter is not equal to tension  <br>
 But  <br>
 In today's world  <br>
 Daughter is equal to  <br>
 Ten son' s  <br>
 🙍👭🙍👭  <br>
   <br>
 A FATHER Asked His DAUGHTER:  <br>
 Who Would U Love More, Me Or Ur Husband..??  <br>
 👭👭🙍🙍👭👭🙍🙍  <br>
   <br>
 The BEST Reply Given By the DAUGHTER:  <br>
 I Don't Know Really,  <br>
 But When I See U,  <br>
 I Forget Him,  <br>
 But When I See Him,  <br>
 I Remember U..  <br>
 🙍🙍🙍👭👭👭👭🙍🙍🙍  <br>
   <br>
 U Can Always Call Ur DAUGHTER As Beta,  <br>
 But U Can Never Call Ur Son As Beti..  <br>
   <br>
 That's Why DAUGHTERS are SPECIAL  <br>

 Congrats  to who all have daughters  <br>
 Daughters are like Parrots in the house..  <br>
   <br>
 When she speaks,  <br>
 Speaks without a break..  <br>
 & everyone says,  <br>
 "Will you please keep quite for sometime"  <br>
   <br>
 When she is silent,  <br>
 mother says,  <br>
 Are you fine my child "  <br>
   <br>
 Father says,  <br>
 "Why there is so much of silence "  <br>
   <br>
 Brother says,  <br>
 "Are you angry with me ?"  <br>
   <br>
 and when she is married, all says,  <br>
 "Its like all the happiness has gone from the house "  <br>
   <br>
 She is the real non stop music..  <br>
   <br>
