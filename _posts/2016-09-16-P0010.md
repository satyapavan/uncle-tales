What is the difference between your mother and wife???  <br>
   <br>
 They both LOVE us  <br>
 Both SACRIFICE for us  <br>
 Both make us EAT more than we require  <br>
 Both make our house into HOME.  <br>
 Both PRAY for us  <br>
 Both are ALWAYS there for us  <br>
 Both LIVE for us  <br>
 then why do..  <br>
   <br>
 We post/say  funny jokes about wife and laugh  <br>
 and always post respectable quote for mother...  <br>
   <br>
 The only difference I can see is  <br>
   <br>
 One brings you into the world...  <br>
 and other makes YOU her world..  <br>
 ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š But most of the  men always take their wives for granted and often ignore them  in important talks ,matters , decisions,plannings etc .because they think that they are inefficient to handle them...  <br>
 Dear men  <br>
 It's true that your mother sacrifices to make you become a leader but a wife sacrifices to maintain your leadership.....  <br>
 your mother gets your affection and care throughout her life  but a wife gets your full attention only when she is near the end of her life......waiting to get your certification of her soulmateðŸ’‘........  <br>
 Please give her importance in early age of her life so that she  can feel that she is not only the princess of her father but also the Queen of her husband.......
