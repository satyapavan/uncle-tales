   <br>
 A 70-year old man was driving his MarutiğŸš—, when he met with a minor accident with an approaching ğŸš™ BMW.  <br>
   <br>
 Four sardars came out of the BMW and started shouting at the old man. Quite enraged seeing the dent on their car, they were about to beat the old man.  <br>
   <br>
 The helpless old man said, "you guys are 4 and I am all by myself and you try to hit me!!! This is so unfair."  <br>
   <br>
 The eldest of the Sardar turned around and said, "Sarabjit and Paramjit, you both go to the other side and team up with uncle."  <br>
   <br>
 And now the old man said, "Still not fair,, we are 3 now and you are only 2."  <br>
   <br>
 Then Sarabjit came forward and told, "Uncleji you go home , we will take care of those two."  <br>
