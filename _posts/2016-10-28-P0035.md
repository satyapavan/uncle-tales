Wife  Lets go for a dinner tonight.  <br>
   <br>
 Husband (HR Manager) - Ok.  <br>
   <br>
 Husband - Should we go to an sasta restaurant ?  <br>
   <br>
 Wife - No. Let's go to Royal Palace hotel.  <br>
   <br>
 Husband - (silence for a minute) - Ok, See you at 7.O 'Clock.  <br>
   <br>
 On the way, around 6.30 pm...  <br>
   <br>
 Husband - Once time, I had pani puri competition with my sister and she ate 30 pani-puris and defeated me.  <br>
   <br>
 Wife - What's so difficult in it?  <br>
   <br>
 Husband - Defeating me in Pani-puri eating competition is so difficult.  <br>
   <br>
 Wife - I can easily beat you.  <br>
   <br>
 Husband - Please leave it. It's not your cup of tea.  <br>
   <br>
 Wife - Let us have that competition right now.  <br>
   <br>
 Husband - So you want to see yourself defeated?  <br>
   <br>
 Wife - Let's see.  <br>
   <br>
 They both stop at a Pani-puri stall and start eating...  <br>
   <br>
 After about 30 Pani-puris the husband gave up.  <br>
   <br>
 The wife was also full, but to defeat her husband, she ate one more and shouted, "You lose."  <br>
   <br>
 The bill was Rs 50/- and wife was back home, happy with her bet win!  <br>
   <br>
 Moral of the Story...  <br>
   <br>
 Main aim of a HR Manager is to satisfy employee with minimum investments. Winning attitude with less investment, ensuring strong Return On Investment! ðŸ˜ƒ ----
