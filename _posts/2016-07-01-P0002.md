Hi All,  new online fraud.  Today I received a mail where the mail id is correct as admin. rf06@incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in. The logo of income tax department is also there.  The mail states that I am qualified for a refund of Rs. 25882.19. It further states that in order to receive the refund submit the refund request in the below link.  <br>
   <br>
 Once you press the link,  it asks for which bank you have account. One you select the bank, it takes you to the bank site and you are to submit your user id and password. I got a doubt first the refund is never in paise.  <br>
   <br>
 Moreover, income tax department has all the account details as I have been filing e-returns and my aadhar and passport is also linked.  <br>
   <br>
 I went to the official site to check if there is any refund and the site says nil.  <br>
   <br>
 Sixth sense prevented me from submitting the user I'd and password. Else I would have been cheated through online fraud.  <br>
   <br>
 Request you all to be careful. Inform your clients n friends too.  <br>
 Take care ..  <br>
